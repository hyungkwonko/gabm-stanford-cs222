What business did you start after working for a larger firm?,"After working for a larger firm, I started my own real estate agency right here in Austin. I wanted to create a place where I could offer personalized service and truly connect with my clients, without all the red tape that comes with bigger companies. It's been a journey, and while it hasn't always been easy, I believe in hard work and the value of building strong relationships in the community."
"What political group did you join, and what beliefs did you strengthen through this association?","I joined a local libertarian group, which really helped me solidify my beliefs in small government and financial independence. It's a community that values personal responsibility and free markets, both of which resonate deeply with me. Being part of that group has allowed me to engage with like-minded individuals who share my concerns about government overreach and the importance of letting people make their own choices without interference."
How did the 2008 housing crisis impact your real estate business?,"The 2008 housing crisis was a tough time for everyone in the real estate business, including me. I faced some serious financial difficulties, which forced me to rethink my business model entirely. I had to adapt quickly—many clients were pulling out of deals, and the market was in a free fall. I learned the importance of diversifying my investments and being more cautious with my financial decisions. It was a wake-up call that taught me resilience and the value of mentoring younger agents who were just starting out. You really had to be on your toes back then, but I came out stronger on the other side."
How long were you married to your college girlfriend before you divorced?,"I was married to my college girlfriend for 12 years before we went our separate ways. It was a tough time, but we managed to work things out for the sake of our daughter. Co-parenting has its challenges, but I believe it's important to put her first."
What role did you hold during high school that taught you leadership and responsibility?,"I was the captain of my high school football team. That experience really taught me about leadership and responsibility. You have to motivate your teammates, make quick decisions, and take accountability for the outcomes. It wasn't just about winning games; it was about building a strong team and knowing that everyone was counting on each other. Those lessons have stuck with me throughout my life, especially in my career in real estate."
"What degree did you earn from the University of Texas, and how did it shape your career?","I earned a degree in business from the University of Texas. That education really laid the foundation for my career in real estate. It taught me the ins and outs of finance, marketing, and management, all of which are crucial in running my own agency. Plus, being at UT exposed me to a network of people and opportunities that have been invaluable. The skills I gained helped me navigate the challenges of starting my own business and understanding the market dynamics here in Austin."
What personal challenge did you face during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The COVID-19 pandemic really put a strain on my work-life balance. As a small business owner, I was juggling a lot—clients were anxious, the market was uncertain, and I had to adapt quickly to remote work. It was a tough time, and I found myself stressed out more than I'd like to admit. I had to learn how to manage my time better and prioritize my health, especially after a health scare with my blood pressure. It pushed me to focus on what truly matters, like spending quality time with my daughter and finding ways to unwind, like playing guitar with friends on the weekends."
What health issue prompted you to focus more on your physical health?,"Well, I had a bit of a scare with my blood pressure a while back. It really made me sit up and take notice of my health. I realized that I needed to be more proactive about staying in shape and eating right. You know, running a small business can be stressful, and it's easy to let that take a toll on your health. So, I've been making a conscious effort to stay active and manage my stress better. It's all about taking responsibility for yourself, right?"
How did your relationship with your daughter change as she grew older?,"Well, as she's gotten older, I've definitely seen her become more independent, which is both a blessing and a challenge. I used to see her every weekend for our little adventures, but now it feels like I have to work harder to keep our connection strong. She's got her own interests, friends, and a busy life, which is natural at her age. I do feel a bit of guilt about missing out on those younger years, but I'm proud of her growing up to be her own person. We still make the most of our time together, whether it's grabbing ice cream or just hanging out at home. It's all about finding that balance and being there for her, even if it's not as often as I'd like."
"What was your long-time dream related to property ownership, and how did you fulfill it?","Well, my long-time dream was to own a piece of land near a lake where I could escape the hustle and bustle of city life. I always envisioned having a place to fish, hike, and spend quality time with my daughter and friends. After years of saving and searching, I finally bought a second property outside of Austin. It's been a labor of love, and I'm excited to create lasting memories there."
"How has your upbringing in rural Texas, learning to hunt and fish with your father, shaped your values and worldview?","Growing up in rural Texas definitely shaped who I am today. Learning to hunt and fish with my father wasn't just about the skills; it instilled in me a strong work ethic and a sense of personal responsibility. Those early mornings in the woods taught me patience and perseverance. I learned that if you want something, you have to put in the effort to get it. It also fostered a deep appreciation for nature and the outdoors, which I still carry with me today. This upbringing has led me to value independence and self-reliance, both in my personal life and in my business. I believe that we should be able to make our own choices without excessive interference from the government. It's all about taking charge of your own destiny."
In what ways did your experience as captain of your high school football team influence your leadership style in your professional and personal life?,"Being captain of my high school football team taught me a lot about responsibility and teamwork. I learned early on that leadership isn't just about calling the shots; it's about bringing people together and motivating them to strive for a common goal. In my real estate agency, I apply that same principle. I mentor younger agents, helping them navigate the industry while fostering a supportive environment. Personally, it taught me the importance of communication and trust, especially in co-parenting with my ex-wife. We may not see eye to eye on everything, but we both want what's best for our daughter, and that's the ultimate goal."
How has your divorce and your evolving relationship with your daughter impacted your sense of responsibility and personal fulfillment?,"Well, going through the divorce was definitely a tough chapter in my life, but it taught me a lot about responsibility and what really matters. My daughter is my priority, and co-parenting has pushed me to step up and be the dad she needs, even if it means seeing her less than I'd like. It's made me appreciate the time we do have together even more. I focus on making those moments count—whether it's grabbing ice cream or just hanging out at home. Personal fulfillment comes from knowing that I'm doing my best for her, and that drives me to keep pushing forward in my work and in life. Every challenge is just another opportunity to grow."
How have your libertarian beliefs influenced your approach to managing your real estate business and navigating financial challenges?,"My libertarian beliefs have definitely shaped the way I run my real estate business. I firmly believe that less government intervention leads to a more vibrant market. So, I focus on helping my clients navigate the complexities of buying and selling properties without the unnecessary red tape that often bogs things down. 

When it comes to financial challenges, my approach is straightforward: I prioritize financial independence and smart investments. I encourage my clients to think long-term and stay out of debt, which is crucial in today's economic climate. I mean, if you're not careful, you can easily get buried under rising costs and regulations. 

Plus, I've always maintained that if we want to see real growth in our communities, we need to advocate for policies that support free markets. That's why I stay active in local libertarian groups; it helps me connect with like-minded folks who share my values. At the end of the day, it's all about empowering individuals to make their own decisions, and I try to instill that in my business practices as well."
"How has your experience with failure, such as losing the election for local office, affected your sense of purpose and resilience?","Losing that election was definitely a tough pill to swallow, but it taught me a lot about resilience and the importance of sticking to my beliefs. I ran because I genuinely wanted to advocate for property rights and push back against the overreach of government. Even though I didn't win, I still believe in those principles deeply. It gave me a clearer sense of purpose in my work and reinforced my commitment to helping people achieve financial independence through smart investments. Failure isn't the end; it's just another stepping stone. I've learned that if you want to make a difference, you've got to keep fighting for what you believe in, whether in politics or business. So, I've taken that experience and channeled it into growing my real estate agency and supporting my community in other ways."
