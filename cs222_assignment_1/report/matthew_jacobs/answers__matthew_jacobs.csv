It's all about building relationships and helping people find their dream homes while navigating the market with less red tape."
"What political group did you join, and what beliefs did you strengthen through this association?","I joined a local libertarian group, and it really helped solidify my beliefs in small government and financial independence. Being part of that community reinforced my conviction that individuals should have the freedom to make their own decisions without unnecessary government interference. We often discuss the importance of free markets and how too much regulation stifles innovation and growth. It's been a great way to connect with like-minded folks who share my views on personal responsibility and limited government."
How did the 2008 housing crisis impact your real estate business?,"The 2008 housing crisis hit me hard, like it did for a lot of folks in the business. I had to pivot my entire business model just to stay afloat. It was a wake-up call that made me realize I couldn't rely solely on traditional methods.

You can't just sit back and wait for things to get better; you have to be proactive and find new opportunities, even in the toughest times."

What role did you hold during high school that taught you leadership and responsibility?,"I was the captain of my high school football team. It was a great experience that taught me a lot about leadership and responsibility. You learn quickly that success is a team effort, and you have to hold yourself accountable while also motivating others. Those lessons have stuck with me and have really shaped how I approach my work in real estate and life in general."
"What degree did you earn from the University of Texas, and how did it shape your career?","I earned a degree in business from the University of Texas, and I can honestly say it laid the groundwork for everything I've done since. It taught me critical thinking, financial principles, and how to effectively manage operations, which are all essential in running my real estate agency. Plus, being in a vibrant city like Austin gave me a front-row seat to the dynamics of the market. Those experiences helped shape my belief in smart investments and financial independence, which I carry into every transaction I handle."
What personal challenge did you face during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The COVID-19 pandemic was a real struggle for me, like it was for many. Balancing my work and personal life became incredibly tough. My real estate business took a hit, and the stress levels shot up as I tried to keep things afloat while also managing my responsibilities as a father. I learned a lot about resilience during that time, but it definitely pushed me to my limits. I had to take a step back and reevaluate things, focusing more on my health and finding ways to cope with the pressure. It wasn't easy, but I got through it by leaning on my friends and staying active outdoors."
What health issue prompted you to focus more on your physical health?,"Well, I had a bit of a health scare related to my blood pressure a while back. It really made me realize that I needed to take better care of myself. I've always been active, but I found myself getting a bit too caught up in work and neglecting my health. So, I started focusing more on staying active and eating right. It's all about balance, you know? If I want to keep growing my business and be there for my daughter, I've got to make sure I'm in good shape."
How did your relationship with your daughter change as she grew older?,"Well, as my daughter got older, I started noticing that we had less time together. It's tough, you know, with her being a teenager and all. She's got her own life now—friends, school activities—and I get that it's a part of growing up. But it does make me feel a bit guilty sometimes for not being there as much as I'd like. We try to make the most of our weekends together, though. Ice cream runs and little projects around the house keep us connected. I just want to make sure she knows I'm always here for her, no matter how busy life gets."
"What was your long-time dream related to property ownership, and how did you fulfill it?","Well, ever since I was a kid, I dreamed of owning a piece of land by the water. The idea of having a lake house where I could escape the hustle and bustle of city life, spend time outdoors, and make memories with my daughter really appealed to me. I finally fulfilled that dream not too long ago when I bought a second property outside Austin. It's a beautiful spot, perfect for fishing and just enjoying nature. It's a place where I can unwind, and I look forward to sharing it with my friends and family."
"How has your upbringing in rural Texas, learning to hunt and fish with your father, shaped your values and worldview?","Growing up in rural Texas, learning to hunt and fish with my father instilled in me a strong sense of self-reliance and hard work. Those early lessons taught me that nothing worth having comes easy. Whether it was tracking game or casting a line, I learned patience, perseverance, and the importance of respecting nature. These values translate into my professional life, where I believe in the power of smart investments and personal responsibility. I also think it shaped my belief in limited government; I saw firsthand how communities thrive when people are empowered to make their own choices. It's all about taking charge of your own life, and I carry that mindset with me every day."
In what ways did your experience as captain of your high school football team influence your leadership style in your professional and personal life?,"Being captain of the football team taught me the importance of teamwork and accountability. I learned that you can't just bark orders and expect people to follow; you have to earn their respect and trust. In my real estate agency, I apply that same principle. I mentor younger agents, guiding them through the ups and downs of the market while encouraging them to take responsibility for their own successes. In my personal life, it's about being there for my daughter and co-parenting effectively. Leadership isn't just about being in charge; it's about lifting others up and showing them the way."
How has your divorce and your evolving relationship with your daughter impacted your sense of responsibility and personal fulfillment?,"Well, going through the divorce was tough, no doubt about it. But it really shaped my sense of responsibility, especially when it comes to my daughter. I realized that even though the marriage didn't work out, my obligation to her remains strong. I want to be there for her, make sure she knows she can count on me, no matter what. It's about finding that balance between work and spending quality time with her. Each weekend we have together, I try to make it special, whether it's grabbing ice cream or just talking about her day. That's where I find my fulfillment now—seeing her happy and knowing I'm doing my part as a dad. It's a different kind of responsibility, but it motivates me every day to work hard and create a stable life for both of us."
How have your libertarian beliefs influenced your approach to managing your real estate business and navigating financial challenges?,"My libertarian beliefs play a significant role in how I run my real estate business. I firmly believe in the importance of personal responsibility and financial independence, which translates into how I interact with my clients and manage my agency. For instance, I prioritize transparency and honesty in all my dealings; I think people deserve to make informed decisions without any government intervention or hidden agendas.

When it comes to navigating financial challenges, my approach is straightforward: I focus on smart investments and minimizing debt. The rising costs in Austin have certainly made things tough, but I believe that instead of relying on government assistance, we should find creative solutions and work harder to adapt to the market.

Additionally, I've written letters to local newspapers advocating for reducing regulations that hinder small businesses. I think if we can cut through the red tape and allow for more free market opportunities, it would benefit not just my business but the entire community. Ultimately, it's about empowering individuals to make choices that are best for them, without the heavy hand of government interference."
"How has your experience with failure, such as losing the election for local office, affected your sense of purpose and resilience?","Losing that election was a tough pill to swallow, no doubt about it. But in a way, it reinforced my sense of purpose. It gave me a clearer understanding of what I stand for—small government and property rights. Failure isn't the end; it's just a stepping stone. I learned that resilience comes from picking yourself up and continuing to fight for what you believe in. I may not have won that election, but I still advocate for my beliefs through my work and community involvement. It's about making a difference, one step at a time."
